# HTML Quine
HTML Document displaying its own source code with CSS

## What is a Quine?

Quine is a program which displays its source code.

## More about this project
I found out a video where a programmer was talking about this cool concept of Quine. He showed 
bunch of different programs written in various programming languages, where source code was 
written like an artwork. It displayed its own source code.

I was not that good in programming. I thought let's try this with HTML. 
Though it is not a programming language, but I gave it a try.

If you want to know how its done, see style.css file in this repository.
